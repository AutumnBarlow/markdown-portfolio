## Autumn Barlow's Technical Writing Portfolio

### Introduction

This is a portfolio site intended to be viewed by potential recruiters and employers in the UK. It contains links to examples of my published work and some sample pieces. These demonstrate the range of my abilities as a writer.

### Detailed Overview

#### Who I am

I am an experienced writer and editor with over ten years' experience. I am currently working as a freelance editor for Helion & Co., a publisher of military history books. This involves a forensic attention to detail, especially for military specifications. I often work with authors whose first language is not English, and have to strike a balance between keeping their original voice while making the text accessible to all readers. 

I have also worked as an editor for John Hunt Publishing and on a freelance basis for independent authors. I was a freelance journalist for some years, specialising in writing about cycling. I am based in the East Midlands.

#### My current objectives

- I am transitioning into Technical Writing as I see that this would be a great fit for my skills. I am fascinated by technology, and have been ever since I built by first PC in 1995/1996 (Windows 3.1 booted from 4 floppy discs!) 
- I am comfortable with HTML/CSS and have undertaken some very basic Python courses. I am in the process of learning more about Python for my own interests, and I have begun to learn JavaScript as the logical next step after HTML/CSS. 
- Ultimately, I intend to find work as a Technical Writer, ideally within the world of software documentation but I would also be open to MOD work. 
- Throughout April and May, I am participating in Write the Doc's Slack community readthrough of *Learn Git in a Month of Lunches*.

### Links to Writing

#### Published writing

I have had dozens of non-fiction articles published for a wide range of audiences. I can adapt my style to the house style of the publication. Here is one example  for <a href="http://autumnbarlow.github.io/technical-writing-portfolio/CAfeb13.pdf" target="_blank">Cycling Active Magazine</a> (the link opens as a PDF in a new tab). Throughout 2013, I had a monthly column in this now-defunct magazine. I had to meet the monthly deadline and provide light, amusing copy to a specified wordcount. 

I have also written monthly columns for Classic Bike Guide, and one-off articles for Women's Cycling, Balance, Lancashire Life and various other publications.


#### Published work I have edited

1. Helion & Co. I have undertaken detailed editing of six non-fiction books in the past year. These are military history books written by experts in their fields. I am not a military history specialist, but I need to be able to quickly grasp the details of the subject matter to ensure accuracy. Often the authors do not have English as their native language, and I need to be sensitive in my editing. It is necessary to retain the author's unique voice while ensuring readability. Please contact me for further details of the books I have collaborated on.
2. John Hunt Publishing. I undertook work on dozens of fiction books between 2012 and 2015. As 'Publisher' at Top Hat Books (this was their title but it was a role more akin to 'Managing Editor') I was responsible for assessing manuscript submissions, working with a team of submission readers, dealing with the contracts and liaising with the authors themselves as well as editing and proofreading. Please contact me for further details on the books.
