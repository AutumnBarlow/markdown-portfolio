## Autumn Barlow's Technical Writing Portfolio

### Introduction

This is a portfolio site intended to be viewed by potential recruiters and employers in the UK. It contains links to examples of my published work and some sample pieces. These demonstrate the range of my abilities as a writer.

### Detailed Overview

#### Who I am

I am an experienced writer and editor with over ten years' experience. I am currently working as a freelance editor for Helion & Co., a publisher of military history books. This involves a forensic attention to detail, especially for military specifications. I often work with authors whose first language is not English, and have to strike a balance between keeping their original voice while making the text accessible to all readers. 

I have also worked as an editor for John Hunt Publishing and on a freelance basis for independent authors. I was a freelance journalist for some years, specialising in writing about cycling. I am based in the East Midlands.

#### My current objectives

- I am transitioning into Technical Writing as I see that this would be a great fit for my skills. I am fascinated by technology, and have been ever since I built by first PC in 1995/1996 (Windows 3.1 booted from 4 floppy discs!) 
- I am comfortable with HTML/CSS and have undertaken some very basic Python courses. I am in the process of learning more about Python for my own interests, and I have begun to learn JavaScript as the logical next step after HTML/CSS. 
- Ultimately, I intend to find work as a Technical Writer, ideally within the world of software documentation but I would also be open to MOD work. 
- Throughout April and May, I am participating in Write the Doc's Slack community readthrough of *Learn Git in a Month of Lunches*.
